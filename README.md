I am creating this basic calculator app to help strengthen all of the skills that i've learned in The Odin Projects foundations course. It's the final project and once I complete it I intend on moving forward with the Javascript pathway to study full-stack web development more in depth. I'm hoping this project will provide the opportunity to clear up as many questions as possible on the topics that i've covered so far. Most notably I would like to practice using event listeners, DOM manipulation, objects and array methods, and CSS layout properties (grid in particular). I also hope that writing the functions required for this calculator will help me sharpen my problem-solving skills.

The end goal is to have created an application that has a visually pleasing and fully-functional UI, while also sporting easy-to-read, clean code under the hood.
