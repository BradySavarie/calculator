defaultValue is initialized to zero
currentValue, operand1, operand2, and operator variables are declared and initialized to defaultValue
currentValue is sent as input to displayValue function on window load
display div and all buttons are targetted for DOM and stored in variables
attach event listeners to each button that senses clicks
write following functions:
    updateCurrentValue, displayValue, storeOperand1, storeOperand2, storeOperator, add, subtract, multiply, divide, operate, invertSign, toPercentage, allClear, clearEntry
add the appropriate functions onto the event listener for each button

when any digit is clicked, updateCurrentValue and displayValue functions are called
the updateCurrentValue function either replaces defaultValue or gets appended to the end of the currentValue

when any operator is clicked, updateOperand1, updateOperator, and displayValue functions are called
displayValue receives the operator as input in this case 

updateOperand1 stores the currentValue in the operand1 variable
updateOperator stores the chosen operator in the operator variable

Once I have these functions ready I will need an operate function that takes 3 parameters: operand1, operand2, operator.

when equals is clicked, the currentValue gets stores in operand2 and the operate function is called.

currentValue, which gets updated when a digit is clicked via an updateCurrentValue function
function is called only when a digit is clicked
the digit either replaces the default value of 0 or gets appended to the end of the currentValue variable, which is then updated in the display
add clear entry button functionality
when button is clicked, the last digit of the current value gets deleted or replaced with zero if only 1 digit. 

the operate function will validate input, and then decide which arithmetic function to run the operands through based on operator variable value. the return value is then displayed.

All clear button should reset currentValue to default value and clear operand1, operand2 and operator variables.
