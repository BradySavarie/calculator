defaultValue is initialized to zero
currentValue, operand1, operand2, and operator variables are declared and initialized to defaultValue
display div is targetted and stored in display variable
currentValue is inserted into the text content of display on window load

first task it to write 5 functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide, percent.

when any digit is clicked, currentValue gets updated via updateCurrentValue function
the updateCurrentValue function either replaces defaultValue or gets appended to the end of the currentValue
updated currentValue replaces the text content of display variable

Once I have these functions ready I will need an operate function that takes 3 parameters: operand1, operand2, operator.

when an operator button is clicked, the currentValue gets stored in variable operand1, operator variable is updated to the operator chosen, and the operator is displayed on screen


the following values that are entered replace the content in the currentValue variable (displayed again as entered)
when equals is clicked, the currentValue gets stores in operand2 and the operate function is called.

currentValue, which gets updated when a digit is clicked via an updateCurrentValue function
function is called only when a digit is clicked
the digit either replaces the default value of 0 or gets appended to the end of the currentValue variable, which is then updated in the display
add clear entry button functionality
when button is clicked, the last digit of the current value gets deleted or replaced with zero if only 1 digit. 

the operate function will validate input, and then decide which arithmetic function to run the operands through based on which operator is selected. the return value is then displayed.

All clear button should reset currentValue to default value and clear operand1 and operand2 variables.
